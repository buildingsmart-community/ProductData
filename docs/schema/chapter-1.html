<p>The scope of this standard is to define the syntactic characteristics of a generic structure to transport data about construction objects based on EN ISO 16739-1:2018, prEN ISO 23386 and prEN ISO 23387.</p>
<p>The application of this standard allows stakeholders in the construction industry to structure, govern, update, maintain and transport their information about construction objects (e.g. product data) through a machine-interpretable format.</p>
<p>In addition, several stakeholders of the process can take the most out from their software technologies, avoiding data replication as well as saving time and improving both quality and transparency. The scenario within which this standard applies affects producers, designers, constructors, facility and property managers.</p>
<p>The syntactic approach considers as primary objective the ability to reuse specifications given in the international standard EN ISO 16739-1:2018. This specific goal is reached by the delivery of the Model View Definition “Construction Objects Data View” (COD) which is made available alongside the others MVD already issued.</p>
<p>Software houses and software application developers can use this standard to implement interfaces for importing and exporting constructions object according to the official standard EN ISO 16739-1:2018.</p>
